# Chain Abstraction & Universal Accounts

Particle Network is solving Web3's fragmentation of users and liquidity through chain abstraction.

## Chain Abstraction

Chain abstraction allows users to transact on any chain with a single, unified balance; aggregating assets they hold anywhere:

- **Unified Balance**: Spend tokens fragmented across multiple chains anywhere in a single transaction.
- **Automated Bridging**: Cross-chain asset transfers happen automatically in the background.

<Info>Chain Absraction at the account-level is enabled by [Universal Accounts](/ua-api-reference).</Info>

## Universal Accounts

Universal Accounts enable chain abstraction by deploying smart accounts with unified balances, enabling the following properties:

- **One Account, One Balance, Any Chain**: A single balance of assets consolidated from every chain a user holds funds on.
- **Chain-Agnostic**: Transact without knowing what chain you're using.
- **Universal Gas**: Pay fees in any token from any chain.

## Key Components

Particle Network combines three powerful features:

1. **Universal Accounts**: Smart accounts with unified balances across all chains.
2. **Universal Liquidity**: Automatic bridging and liquidity routing.
3. **Universal Gas**: Pay transaction fees in any token.
