# Particle Network Documentation

Particle Network enables **Chain Abstraction** through **Universal Accounts**, giving users a single, unified account and balance usable on any chain.

**In essence**: Particle Network allows users to spend assets held on any number of chains, collectively, on any destination chain without bridging.

Whether you're getting started or already familiar with chain abstraction, this documentation helps you:

- Integrate Universal Accounts in any web app
- Understand how Chain Abstraction works

<Info>
Universal Accounts let you build applications that work across chains by default—with one user account, one balance, and no bridging logic. For users, it means simpler onboarding and native multi-chain UX.
