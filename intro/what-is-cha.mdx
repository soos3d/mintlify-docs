**Chain Abstraction** is the principle of eliminating multi-chain friction from the user experience. Instead of forcing users to bridge assets over to the chain(s) your dApp is deployed on, they can instead use their **collective onchain balance** to transact on your dApp, without bridging.

<Info>
For developers, this means building on one chain, but serving users from all of them—without requiring bridging, chain switching, or holding multiple gas tokens.
</Info>

**Chain Abstraction** enables apps to:

- Onboard users from **any ecosystem** without requiring prior wallets or bridging steps.
- Deploy on **a single chain** and still reach users on **other chains** without fragmentation.
- Radically improve the onboarding experience for both new and existing users.

Particle Network enables Chain Abstraction via **Universal Accounts**.

## Why Chain Abstraction Matters

Web3 today is fragmented:

- Users manage **multiple balances or wallets** for different chains.
- Each chain has its own **native gas token** (ETH, SOL, BNB, etc.).
- Bridging assets is **complex and error-prone**.
- dApp developers must re-deploy their apps across multiple chains.

Chain abstraction fixes this by shifting complexity away from users and into infrastructure—so users and developers get one consistent experience across the entire ecosystem.

## Key Properties of Chain Abstraction

**1. One Account Across All Chains**  
Users interact through a **Universal Account** with a single address and balance across ecosystems.

**2. Unified Liquidity**  
Transactions automatically route liquidity behind the scenes, removing the need for bridges or manual swaps.

**3. Universal Gas**  
Users can pay gas fees with **any token** from **any chain**, abstracting away the need to hold native gas tokens.


Particle Network enables chain abstraction by coordinating these three pillars through its **infrastructure**
