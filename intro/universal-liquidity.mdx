**Universal Liquidity** is the mechanism that powers cross-chain transactions in [Universal Accounts](/intro/universal-accounts). It allows users to spend or transfer assets across any chain—automatically and atomically—without needing to manually bridge, swap, or move tokens between networks.

This functionality is built into **Particle's Universal SDK**, enabling developers to give users a single, unified balance across all supported chains. The SDK handles everything: sourcing funds, executing cross-chain logic, and coordinating settlement between networks.

For example, if a user wants to transact on a chain where they don’t hold funds, **Universal Liquidity** automatically pulls the required tokens from their balances on other chains. The process is invisible to the user, and they can pay gas in **any token**, on any chain.

This makes using a multi-chain dApp feel like using a single-chain app—no bridges, no manual steps, just one smooth experience.

# Understanding Universal Liquidity

Universal Liquidity is made possible through Particle Network’s Modular Nodes and Decentralized Messaging Network.

Particle Network acts as a coordination and settlement layer for all cross-chain transactions processed through [Universal Accounts](/intro/universal-accounts). Alongside Bundler Nodes, Universal Liquidity is responsible for the automatic execution of operations across chains, enabling a universal balance capable of being consumed on any blockchain.

## Implementation of Universal Liquidity

Universal Liquidity is primarily implemented through the means of [Universal Accounts](/intro/universal-accounts). When a user onboards to an application integrating Particle Network’s Universal SDK, their EOA (MetaMask, Keplr, Particle, or UniSat wallet) will be assigned as a signer for a [Universal Account](/intro/universal-accounts) instance. They can then fund the account and begin using the dApp in question. Importantly, Universal Accounts can be used within all other compatible applications across different chains without requiring users to bridge assets; this property is powered by Universal Liquidity.
