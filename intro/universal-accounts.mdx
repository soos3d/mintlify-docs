___

**Universal Accounts** are the Chain Abstraction infrastructure built by Particle that give users one account to use across all supported blockchains—EVM and non-EVM—with a **single balance**, **address**, and **interface**.

Instead of managing different wallets, tokens, and apps per chain, users interact through a Universal Account as if the entire Web3 ecosystem were one network.

This is possible because Particle Network handles all the complexity behind the scenes—automatically routing liquidity, bridging assets, and managing cross-chain logic using [Universal Liquidity](/intro/universal-liquidity).

For developers, Universal Accounts are smart contract-based accounts that integrate easily into dApps using the [Universal SDK](/universal-accounts/ua-reference/overview). They're compatible with both social logins and wallet connections, and support gasless, cross-chain operations out of the box.

# Understanding Universal Accounts

Universal Accounts are smart contract accounts powered by Particle Network's [Universal Liquidity](/intro/universal-liquidity) technology, enabling seamless cross-chain transactions and interactions.

## Key Features

### Chain Abstraction
- One account works across all chains with a unified balance
- Automatic bridging and cross-chain transactions
- Single gas token for all operations
- Seamless assets transfers between chains

### Smart Account Implementation
- Built on ERC-4337 standard
- Compatible with existing EOA wallets
- Supports social login integration

## How It Works

1. **Account Creation**
   - Created through social login or wallet connection
   - Automatically assigned to user's EOA

2. **Cross-Chain Operations**
   - Transactions submitted to the account are funded using a users collective onchain balance, automatically bridging as needed
   - Gasless transactions available

3. **Integration**
   - Simple SDK implementation, taking any EOA signer
   - Compatible with existing dApp infrastructure
