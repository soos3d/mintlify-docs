The **Universal Accounts SDK** brings **chain abstraction** to your app by enabling a single account (Universal Account) that works across **EVM chains, Bitcoin, and Solana**. Users interact with one address, one balance, and can pay gas in any token—regardless of the underlying chain.

---

## Why Universal Accounts?

Traditional multi-chain UX is fragmented:

- Users need separate wallets for each chain
- They must hold multiple gas tokens (ETH, SOL, BNB, etc.)
- Asset bridging is manual and error-prone

**Chain abstraction** solves this by removing the concept of **chains** from the user experience. With **Universal Accounts** (UA), your users get:

- A single address across all supported chains
- A unified balance and asset view
- Gas abstraction — pay fees with any token
- Automatic liquidity routing and bridging behind the scenes

The Universal Account SDK handles this for you—abstracting away complexity and enabling true multi-chain UX in just a few lines of code.

<Info title="Integration Context">
These examples use a React-based app with **Particle Auth** for authentication and wallet connection.

The **Universal Accounts SDK is provider-agnostic** — you can also use **Particle Connect**, **Web3Modal**, **RainbowKit**, or any **EIP-1193-compatible provider**.

You can also use the SDK server-side to construct and sign transactions programmatically.

The SDK plugs into your existing connection flow. Here’s the standard pattern:

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. User connects">
    User connects via a wallet or social login (e.g. Particle Auth, MetaMask, WalletConnect).
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Initialize Universal Account">
    Once connected, pass the user's EOA address to the SDK and configure project details.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Use the UA instance">
    Use the returned Universal Account instance to send transactions, get balances, and sign messages across chains.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Under the hood, all routing, bridging, and gas abstraction is handled by Particle Network's infrastructure.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Once your app is set up, install the **Universal Accounts SDK**:

<CodeGroup>
```bash yarn
yarn add @particle-network/universal-account
```
```bash npm
npm install @particle-network/universal-account
```
</CodeGroup>


### Import and Configure 

You can access and import the `UniversalAccount` class in your app from `@particle-network/universal-account`:

```tsx
import { UniversalAccount } from "@particle-network/universal-account";
```

Then, initialize the UA instance once a user has connected:

<Note>
You'll need a **Universal Account Project ID (API key)** for this step.
</Note>

```tsx
const ua = new UniversalAccount({
  projectId: "YOUR_UA_PROJECT_ID", // Replace with your actual key
  ownerAddress: "USERS_EOA_ADDRESS",     // The user’s EOA address
  tradeConfig: {
    slippageBps: 100,           // Optional: 100 = 1% slippage tolerance
    universalGas: true          // Optional: let user pay gas in PARTI token
  },
});
```

You can now use the `ua` instance to **fetch data** (universal balance, universal address) and send **transactions**.

## Get Universal Account Addresses

A **Universal Account** exposes multiple addresses, each relevant to a specific layer of interaction:

1. **Owner Address** – The original EOA that owns the Universal Account and signs transactions (e.g., from MetaMask or social login).
2. **EVM Universal Address** – The **UA** address used on EVM-compatible chains.
3. **Solana Universal Address** – The **UA** address used on Solana.

<Note>
The EVM and Solana Universal Addresses are distinct because of how deposits work on each network.

You can deposit any **EVM token** to the **EVM Universal Address**, and any **Solana token** to the **Solana Universal Address**. These assets are still accessible through the **same UA instance**, and balance lookups and transactions remain unified at the SDK level.
</Note>


You can retrieve all relevant addresses from an initialized Universal Account instance:

```ts
const smartAccountOptions = await ua.getSmartAccountOptions();

const accountInfo = {
  ownerAddress: smartAccountOptions.ownerAddress, // EOA that owns the Universal Account
  evmUaAddress: smartAccountOptions.smartAccountAddress!, // EVM UA
  solanaUaAddress: smartAccountOptions.solanaSmartAccountAddress!, // SOL UA
};

console.log("Smart Account info:", accountInfo);
```

## Fetch Primary Assets

Universal Accounts can hold any asset across all supported chains. Among these, **primary assets** are the tokens that can be used as **sources for transactions**—they’re prioritized for liquidity routing, swaps, and gas payments.

<Note>
Default primary assets include:
- **ETH**, **USDT**, **USDC**, **BTC**, **SOL**, **BNB**
</Note>
Users can hold these assets on *[any chain](/universal-accounts/cha/chains)*, and the SDK will automatically select the most efficient source and route to execute the transaction.

For example, if a user initiates a swap to `$PARTI` on BNB Chain, the SDK will:
- Determine the optimal primary asset from the user's portfolio (e.g., USDT on Polygon)
- Handle liquidity routing through the Particle infrastructure
- Complete the transaction on BNB Chain—even if the user holds **no assets on BNB Chain directly**

You can fetch the **primary assets** balance from the Universal Account instance with one call:

```ts
const primaryAssets = await ua.getPrimaryAssets();

console.log("Primary Assets:", JSON.stringify(primaryAssets, null, 2));
```

The `getPrimaryAssets()` method returns a list of **primary assets** held by the Universal Account across all supported chains.

<Note>
Each asset includes metadata and a breakdown of holdings per chain.
</Note>

The response returned by `getPrimaryAssets()` has the following structure:

```ts
{
  assets: AssetInfo[],
  totalAmountInUSD: number
}
```

### Asset Structure: `AssetInfo`

Each entry in the `assets` array represents a single token type aggregated across chains:

| Field             | Description                                       |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `tokenType`       | Token identifier (e.g., "eth", "usdt")            |
| `price`           | Current USD price                                 |
| `amount`          | Total amount across chains (human-readable)       |
| `amountInUSD`     | Total USD value                                   |
| `chainAggregation`| Per-chain balance breakdowns                      |

### `chainAggregation` format

Each `chainAggregation` entry details the balance and metadata of the token on a specific chain:

| Field               | Description                                     |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `token.chainId`     | Chain ID                                        |
| `token.address`     | Token contract address                          |
| `amount`            | Token amount (human-readable float)             |
| `amountInUSD`       | USD value                                       |
| `rawAmount`         | Token amount in raw units (integer, stringified)|
| `token.decimals`    | ERC-20 decimals                                 |
| `token.realDecimals`| Adjusted decimals for display                   |
| `token.isMultiChain`| Part of multi-chain registry                    |
| `token.isMultiChainDefault` | Default canonical version across chains |

<Note>
For native assets like `ETH`, the `token.address` field will be `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`.

## Sending a Swap Transaction

The Universal Accounts SDK supports initiating **buy/swap transactions** directly through the `createBuyTransaction()` method. This allows you to programmatically route an amount in **USD** into a target token (e.g., USDT on Arbitrum)—without requiring the user to hold funds on the destination chain.

Once the transaction is created, it returns a `rootHash` representing the payload to be signed. You then use your EIP-1193 provider (in this case, Particle Auth) to sign the message, and pass the result into sendTransaction() to broadcast it.

```ts
import { CHAIN_ID, UniversalAccount } from "@particle-network/universal-account";
import { getBytes, hexlify } from "ethers";
import { useEthereum } from "@particle-network/authkit";

// extract the provider from Particle Auth
const { provider } = useEthereum();

// In your app
const transaction = await ua.createBuyTransaction({
  token: {
    chainId: CHAIN_ID.ARBITRUM_MAINNET_ONE,
    address: "0xFd086bC7CD5C481DCC9C85ebE478A1C0b69FCbb9", // USDT on Arbitrum
  },
  amountInUSD: "10", // Target amount in USD sourced from primary assets held
});

const messageToSign = hexlify(getBytes(transaction.rootHash));
const signature = await provider.signMessage(messageToSign);

const result = await ua.sendTransaction(transaction, signature);
console.log("Explorer URL:", `https://universalx.app/activity/details?id=${result.transactionId}`);
```

The `sendTransaction` method returns a `TransactionResult` object, which includes the transaction ID and other metadata.
