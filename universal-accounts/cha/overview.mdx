## What Are Universal Accounts?

**Universal Accounts** are unified **smart contract accounts** that work across multiple chains—including **EVM** and **Solana**—with:

- A **single address and balance** across all [supported chains](/universal-accounts/cha/chains)
- **Gas abstraction** (pay with any token from any chain)
- **Automatic bridging**, so users can spend assets held on other chains

With just a few lines of code via the **Universal Account SDK**, you can enable Universal Accounts in your dApp and make it possible to onboard users from any ecosystem, allow them to use funds from any chain, and sign once to execute actions—**regardless of where your dApp is deployed**.

## Integration Flow

The **Universal Account SDK** is designed for fast, minimal lift integrations with common wallet connection mechanisms. 

Under the hood, it wraps any existing EIP-1193 wallet provider object (e.g., Social Logins, MetaMask, WalletConnect) and routes all transactions through the user's Universal Account (an ERC-4337 smart account).

The general flow:
1. **Configure** the account using a single config object.
2. **Wrap** your existing provider object (from RainbowKit or any other connection mechanism) using the SDK.
3. Push transactions as usual; no other codebase changes needed. A users balance will be treated as the collective of the chains they hold funds on.

Once integrated, all transactions, balance reads, and gas handling automatically use the Universal Account—**no additional code for bridging or gas logic required**.

<Note>
Universal Accounts are smart contract accounts. Existing assets in a user's current wallet are not automatically included. Users can transfer assets into their Universal Account from any supported chain via in-app flows; you may also make Universal Accounts an optional toggle within your app if you prefer to maintain EOAs as the default account mechanism.
